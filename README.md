# Planet Tracker API 

I needed to very lazily keep track of what systems didnt have war assets, so this, shockingly lazy api lets me do that. 

send it a name and itl tell you if it knows about it 

post it a new name and itl store it 

thats it, there are no build instructions, if you try to use this thing, thats likely a mistake, but you might try docker build
